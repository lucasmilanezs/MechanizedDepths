# 📁 Sprite Source Declaration & Licensing

This document serves to formally declare and list the **base materials, visual references, and sprite sources** used during the development of all custom textures, GUI elements, and in-game icons for this modpack.

My goal is to ensure full **transparency, attribution responsibility, and licensing compliance**, especially in modding environments that intersect with derivative or creative assets.

---

## ✅ Licensing Statement

All assets created for this modpack — including but not limited to items, blocks, fluids, GUIs, and icons — are either:

1. **Fully original and handcrafted**, or  
2. **Derived strictly from openly licensed, permissive-base materials**

> **No assets protected by restrictive licenses** (such as proprietary, closed-source game art, or commercial-use only assets) were used at any stage of production — **not directly, not as base layers, and not as reconstruction references**.

## 🎨 Sprite Base Resources

Below is a list of the primary material sources used as foundation, reference, or modular base for creating custom sprites:

## 🖌️ Production Workflow Notes

- All sprite files are **drawn or finalized in Aseprite**, sometimes refined in **Photopea** or **Krita**.
- Any reused structures (e.g., bolt shapes, liquid containers, pipe outlines) were either **originally created or based on permissive references**.
- No part of this project includes lifted, overpainted, or reprocessed proprietary content — even if heavily modified.

## 🤖 About AI-Generated Visual Elements

Some visual elements present in this modpack — such as **chapter title images, GUI backgrounds, or decorative composite art** — may have been **partially or fully generated using AI tools**.

These assets were created to serve as **temporary placeholders or prototypes**, assisting in the rapid development of a cohesive aesthetic.

> ⚠️ **There is a clear and stated intent to replace these AI-generated assets in the future**, when financially viable, with **handcrafted, commissioned artwork** produced by independent artists.

We recognize the importance of supporting original creators and fostering ethical creative ecosystems — and any AI-generated asset currently in use is treated as a bridge, not a final solution.

---

## 📄 Legal Position

This modpack and its associated graphical content are produced under a strict internal rule of **ethical asset creation**, respecting the work of original developers, artists, and the broader modding ecosystem.

If at any point an issue arises regarding authorship or license conflict, we are open to **revision, attribution, or removal** of any questioned asset — though every measure has been taken to prevent such situations.
